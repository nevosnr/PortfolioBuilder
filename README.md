## The Portfolio
Off the back of my final project module towards a BSc(Hons) in Computer Science, I have developed this web application to showcase my skillset.
.Net Core 9.0 and Blazor were chosen primarily as a means to enter the enterprise development space once my time with the Royal Air Force ends. 

This application is a living document and as such will evolve over time. Hosting on Azure App Services, with a Azure SQL Database backend on the free tiers so database access
may be limited at times.

## David Neve -  CV (About.razor)
This page/component will show my career history to-date in a timeline format. This is where I showcase the use of MudBlazor and especially EF Core to pull data from a SQL database.
Each 'card' is populated from the DB and using a simple LINQ query, sorted to show the most recent first.

## Aircraft Recognition Quiz (Recognise.razor)

This page is a re-engineer of the first JHub module I completed to showcase my understanding of basic HTML, CSS and JS. Here, it is really written in C# and Blazor. it is still raw in form - if you continually select the correct answer it will increment! 

## UK Police Data (Richweb1b.razor)

This is module 1b of a JHub exercise, using open API to provide 'live' data. using the UK Police API, you are able to visually display a boundary within a specified Police force and, through a table view crime data that isnt location tagged. 

The aspiration was to create a visual representation of all crimes and locations through the open maps API. however the geo data for each police force was too great for the request so kept failing. A future option could be to square off the boundaries and reduce the lat long data at the cost of reduced accuracy. 

## Other pages.

As the application grows I will aim to show off more elements within .Net and my skill in its use. I predominantly work from text book and seek to understand the code rather than follow the current trend of vibe coding.
