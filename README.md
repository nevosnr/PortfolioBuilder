## The Portfolio
Off the back of my final project module towards a BSc(Hons) in Computer Science, I have developed this web application to showcase my skillset.
.Net Core 9.0 and Blazor were chosen primarily as a means to enter the enterprise development space once my time with the Royal Air Force ends. 

This application is a living document and as such will evolve over time. Hosting on Azure App Services, with a Azure SQL Database backend on the free tiers so database access
may be limited at times.

## David Neve -  CV (About.razor)
This page/component will show my career history to-date in a timeline format. This is where I showcase the use of MudBlazor and especially EF Core to pull data from a SQL database.
Each 'card' is populated from the DB and using a simple LINQ query, sorted to show the most recent first.
