			This timeline content is hosted on an Azure SQL Database and through adopting a code-first design in .NET and Entity Framework, the DB was created in C#. Previous projects have adopted a Database-first approach which is 
			more relevant in enterprsie/industry as a datbase noramlly already exists. That being said I am able to develop in SQL, and create Tables, Views and stored procedures as required. 
			<br />
			As the timeline is hosted on Azure (on the free tier) there may be a delay in record retrival as the DB may have been placed in a paused state. The backend is programmed to retry 5 times in 15 seconds which should 
			be ample time for the instance to run up. If not, please navigate away and return to view the results.
